SimpliGames
====================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peoii/SimpliGames.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peoii/SimpliGames)

This whole project started as a simple listing online of the games my wife and I own, want, and have tried but don't wish to purchase.
I liked working on it well enough that I decided to place this online anyone interested to try out.

### _Installation_
1. clone the repository or download zip and extract
2. ensure the .json files are in the proper group to be written by the web server (www-data or similar) and remove the .sample portion of the name
3. modify the config.php.sample file with your preferences and administration password
4. rename config.php.sample to config.php
5. modify the stylesheet to your liking and/or replace the images

### _Notes_
Coming Soon

### _Roadmap_
* Edit owned expansions in browser
* Round out look and feel of overall app - *In Progress*

### _Possible Future Inclusions_
* Search
* "Cliff Note" style rules
* Barcode Scan-To-Add (potential, need a solid mobile library)
* Check to move from Wish -> Owned
* Admin interface for adding users (low priority, shouldn't change often)
* Consider local caching of data
